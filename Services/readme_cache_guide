For Small to Medium-Sized Data: Use IMemoryCache for simple in-memory caching.
For Large Data or Distributed Systems: Use IDistributedCache with Redis or SQL Server.
For Automatic Query Caching with EF Core: Consider using a second-level cache like EFCore Second Level Cache Interceptor.
For Complex Needs: Implement a custom caching strategy.
